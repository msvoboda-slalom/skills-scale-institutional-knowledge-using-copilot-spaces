# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments (*Led by: Product Manager with Business Analyst*)
- Identify dependencies and risks (*Led by: Project Manager with Technical Lead*)
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities (*Led by: Project Manager with all team leads*)
- Define test strategy and quality approach (*Led by: QA Lead*)
- Plan deployment and operational requirements (*Led by: Support/Operations Lead*)

## Activities

| Activity | Owner | Collaborators | Output |
|----------|-------|---------------|--------|
| 1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team | Project Manager | All team members | Aligned understanding and kickoff notes |
| 2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria | Product Manager | Business Analyst, UX Designer | Prioritized backlog |
| 3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) | Technical Lead | Developers | Effort estimates |
| 4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) | QA Lead | Technical Lead, Developers | DoD document |
| 5. Identify dependencies and integration points | Project Manager | Technical Lead, Business Analyst | Dependency map |
| 6. Create release plan and milestone map | Project Manager | Product Manager, Technical Lead, Ops Lead | Release timeline |
| 7. Define test approach and environments | QA Lead | Technical Lead, Ops Lead | Test strategy document |
| 8. Plan deployment and rollback procedures | Support/Ops Lead | Technical Lead, Developers | Deployment plan |

**Handoff from Initiation**: Project Manager receives approved one-pager and initial requirements.
**Handoff to Execution**: Developers and QA Lead receive sprint backlog with clear acceptance criteria and DoD.

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length (*Facilitated by: Project Manager*)
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria (*Led by: Product Manager*)
- Ensure team capacity is respected (*Monitored by: Project Manager and Technical Lead*)
- Technical design discussions for complex items (*Led by: Technical Lead*)
- Identify testing needs for sprint items (*Led by: QA Lead*)

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register (*Owner: Project Manager*):
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Technical risks identified and assessed (*Owner: Technical Lead*)
- Quality risks and testing constraints (*Owner: QA Lead*)
- Operational and deployment risks (*Owner: Support/Ops Lead*)
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs (*Escalation path: PM → Product Lead → Sponsor*)

## Planning Checklist
- [ ] Project kickoff held (*Owner: Project Manager*)
- [ ] Backlog prioritized and estimated (*Owner: Product Manager + Technical Lead*)
- [ ] Release timeline and milestones agreed (*Owner: Project Manager*)
- [ ] Definition of Done documented (*Owner: QA Lead*)
